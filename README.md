# Weather Comparison Visualization

## Context
I am fortunate to have lived in a few places throughtout my life, from my hometown of Hanoi, Vietnam to my next venture in Victoria, Canada. This visualization provides critical information when I need to plan for my subsequent moves. 

## Data
Weather data for each city are provided by [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search) and except for Victoria are of the last year of the time I lived in that city:  
- Hanoi (2012-09-04 - 2013-08-30)  
- St. Peter (2016-06-01 - 2017-05-31)  
- San Francisco (2017-06-01 - 2019-09-05)  
- Oakland (2018-05-01 - 2019-09-05)  
- Swarthmore (2019-06-15 - 2020-06-14)  
- Victoria (2019-06-16 - 2020-06-15)
