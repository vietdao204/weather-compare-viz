# Weather Comparison Visualization

## Context
I am fortunate to have lived in a few places throughtout my life, from my hometown of Hanoi, Vietnam to my next venture in Victoria, Canada. This visualization is helpful when I need to plan for my subsequent moves. 

## Data
Weather data for each city are provided by [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search) and except for Victoria, are of the last year of the time I lived in that city:  
- Hanoi (Sep 2012 - Aug 2013)  
- St. Peter (Jun 2016 - May 2017)  
- San Francisco (Jun 2017 - May 2019)  
- Oakland (May 2018 - Sep 2019)  
- Swarthmore (Jun 2019 - Jun 2020)  
- Victoria (Jun 2019 - Jun 2020)
